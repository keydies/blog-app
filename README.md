# How to run:

Install dependencies on client and server side:

cd client || server => type "yarn" in a terminal.

# After that open in parallel terminals client and server side.

Run server => type "yarn dev" in a terminal, after that run client => type "yarn dev" in a terminal.

# If you can't use some of the features

Write @keydies in a Telegram. Most likely, I need to add your IP address to the database.

# Structure

In client side, I used feature-slices-design pattern. Read here: https://feature-sliced.design/docs
In server side, I used a classic pattern for backend apps developed in TS.
